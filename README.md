# Quick_Help_Me_Sort_This
A niche problem needs a niche solution. 

I had a list of options numbered 1 - 8 and then I had to rank them after reading them all through.
Repeatively, this process got tedious FAST.

To solve this, this program simply lets you enter a variable score for each option. You can enter a relatively higher or lower score as you go and finally it would output the desired order of options at the end :).

Optimisation is unneeded but the choice of median qsort allows for a time complexity of O(nlogn) which is ideal.
